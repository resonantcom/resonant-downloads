## Why Resonant

You speak **5x faster** than you type. Resonant turns that into a superpower.

- **100% local processing** — Speech recognition runs entirely on-device. Nothing is sent to any server, ever.
- **Works offline** — No internet required. Dictate anywhere, anytime.
- **Near-instant transcription** — No cloud round-trip means no latency. Words appear as fast as you speak.
- **System-wide dictation** — Works in every app: Slack, iMessage, Gmail, Notion, VS Code, Cursor, Obsidian, and more.
- **25 languages** — Optimized for English, fluent in 24 others.
- **Optimized for Apple Silicon** — Built for M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 processors.

## Features

### Dictation
Speak into any text field on your Mac. Resonant provides live transcription preview with elegant visual feedback. Smart rewrites finish your thoughts, and adaptive tone matches the app you're in — formal for email, casual for Slack, technical for code.

### Memo Mode
Capture ideas as voice notes. Instantly searchable, always local. No context switching — just speak and move on.

### Dispatch Mode
Voice-activated background tasks. Say a command and Resonant routes it to the right tool:
- **Claude Code** — send tasks to your IDE agent
- **Perplexity** — deep research questions
- **Browser** — search the web
- **Any Mac app** — launch by name

### Relay
Turn your phone into a wireless microphone over your local network. No app download needed — works in any browser. Talk to your Mac from across the room.

## Privacy

Resonant is built on a simple principle: **your voice is yours**.

- Audio is processed in real-time and immediately discarded
- No telemetry on what you dictate
- No data monetization — we sell software, not data
- Crash reports (via Sentry) never include voice data or transcriptions
- GDPR compliant
